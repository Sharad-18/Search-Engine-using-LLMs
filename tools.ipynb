His father, Prem Nath Kohli, worked as a criminal lawyer, and his mother, Saroj Kohli, served as a housewife. He has an older brother, Vikas, and an older sister, Bhawna.  Kohli's formative years were spent in Uttam Nagar. He commenced his early education at Vishal Bharti Public School. According to his family, Kohli exhibited an early affinity for cricket as a three-year-old. He would pick up a cricket bat and request his father to bowl to him.\\nIn 1998, the West Delhi Cricket Academy (WDCA) was created. On 30 May of that year, Prem Nath Kohli, who'd espoused his younger son's fervour for cricket, assisted nine-year-old Kohli's aspirations and arranged for him to meet Rajkumar Sharma. Upon the suggestion of their neighbours, Kohli's father considered enrolling his son in a professional cricket academy, as they believed that his cricketing abilities merited more than just playing in gully cricket. Despite his abilities, he faced the setback of being unable to secure a place in the under-14 Delhi team, supposedly due to extraneous factors. Prem Kohli reportedly received offers to relocate his son to influential clubs, which would have ensured his selection, but he declined the proposals. Kohli eventually found his way into the under-15 Delhi team. H\"),\n",

The team's coach, Chetan Chauhan was impressed by Kohli's resolute determination and unwavering attitude in the face of adversity. Venkatesh Prasad also lauded his crucial knock, which was executed in the midst of an emotional upheaval. Following his dismissal, Kohli attended his father's funeral.

On 24 January 2008, an auction was held in Mumbai for the league\\'s teams, which represented eight different cities in India, including Bangalore. The Bangalore franchise was acquired by Vijay Mallya for US$111.6 million, making it the second-highest bid, slightly less than Reliance Industries\\' US$111.9 million bid for the Mumbai Indians.\\n\\nAhead of the 2008 player auction, the IPL designated Rahul Dravid as the icon player for the Bangalore franchise. This designation ensured that Dravid would be paid 15% more than the highest bid player at the auction. The franchise acquired several prominent Indian and international players, including Jacques Kallis, Anil Kumble, Zaheer Khan, Mark Boucher, Dale Steyn, and Cameron White. In the second round of the auction, they also signed Ross Taylor, Misbah-ul-Haq, and India under-19 World Cup-winning captain Virat Kohli.  The franchise named Dravid as the captain of the team and appointed Venkatesh Prasad as the head coach. The team struggled in the inaugural season, winning only four out of their 14 matches and finishing seventh in the eight-team table. Dravid was the sole player to score more than 300 runs in the tournament, and the team even had to bench their most expensive foreign player, Kallis, for several matches due to his poor form. Midway through the season, the string of failures led to the sacking of CEO Charu Sharma, who was replaced by Brijesh Patel. Mallya publicly criticized Dravid and Sharma for their selection of players at the auction, stating that his \"biggest mistake was to abstain from the selection of the team.\" Eventually, the chief cricketing officer of the franchise, Martin Crowe, resigned and Prasad was replaced by Ray Jennings as the head coach.\\nAt the 2009 player auction, the franchise signed Kevin Pietersen for a record US$1.55 million, making him the most expensive player alongside Andrew Flintoff (Chennai Super Kings). They also traded Zaheer Khan for Robin Uthappa with the Mumbai Indians and brought in local batsman Manish Pandey. Due to general elections in India, the tournament was held in South Africa. Pietersen was named captain, but after a string of initial losses, Anil Kumble took over the captaincy when Pietersen left for national duty. RCB\\'s performance improved under Kumble, winning six of their last eight matches to finish third in the league table. They defeated Chennai Super Kings in the semi-final but fell short by six runs in the final against Deccan Chargers.\\n\\nIn 2010, the Royal Challengers, under Kumble\\'s captaincy, secured seven wins from 14 matches, accumulating 14 points.

It was played and adopted by Kolis of Gujarat because they were sea pirates and outlaws who always loot the British ships so East India Company tried to manage the Kolis in cricket and been successful. In 1848, the Parsi community in Mumbai formed the Oriental Cricket Club, the first cricket club to be established by Indians. After slow beginnings, the Europeans eventually invited the Parsis to play a match in 1877. By 1912, the Parsis, Hindus, Sikhs and Muslims of Bombay played a quadrangular tournament with the Europeans every year. In the early 1900s, some Indians went on to play for the England cricket team. Some of these, such as Ranjitsinhji and Duleepsinhji were greatly appreciated by the British and their names went on to be used for the Ranji Trophy and Duleep Trophy – two major first-class tournaments in India. In 1911, an Indian men's cricket team, captained by Bhupinder Singh of Patiala, went on their first official tour of the British Isles, but only played English county teams and not the England cricket team.\\n\\n\\n=== Test match status (1918–1970) ===\\n\\nIndia was invited to the International Cricket Council in 1926, and made their debut as a Test playing nation in England in 1932, led by CK Nayudu, who was considered the best Indian batsman at the time. The one-off Test match between the two sides was played at Lord's in London. The team was not strong in their batting at this point and went on to lose by 158 runs. India hosted its first men's Test cricket series in 1933. England was the visiting team that played two Tests in Bombay (now Mumbai) and Calcutta (now Kolkata). The visitors won the series 2–0. The Indian team continued to improve throughout the 1930s and 1940s but did not achieve an international victory during this period. In the early 1940s, India did not play any men's Test cricket due to World War II. The team's first series as an independent country was in late 1947 against Don Bradman's Australian cricket team in \"),\n",

The world's second-oldest cricket club, Calcutta Cricket Club, was founded in 1792 in present-day Kolkata. The Parsis were the first civilian community to accept cricket as a sport and play it in India. In 1848, they set up the Oriental Cricket Club in present-day Mumbai. In 1850, they founded the Young Zoroastrian Cricket Club. In 1886, Hindus founded the Hindu Gymkhana sports club.\\nIn 1912, an all-India cricket team visited England for the first time, and were sponsored and captained by the Maharaja of Patiala.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and multiple series being postponed, the league standings were determined by percentage of points earned. On 2 February 2021, Australia postponed their away series against South Africa, resulting in a guaranteed berth in the final for New Zealand. On 6 March 2021, India also confirmed their berth for the final, after beating England by 3–1 in a home Test series.\\nThe final was initially due to be held at Lord\\'s, but on 10 March 2021 the International Cricket Council (ICC) confirmed that the game had been moved to the Rose Bowl as the ground\\'s on-site hotels made the venue suitable to establish a bubble environment, made necessary by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. England had used the ground for some of their international fixtures in 2020. On 8 June 2021, the ICC appointed the match officials for the final, with Michael Gough and Richard Illingworth named as the on-field umpires. Prior to the final, the Indian team played a four-day intra-squad practice match between Captain Virat Kohli XI and Captain KL Rahul XI at the Rose Bowl. Indian cricketers had not played in any matches since the suspension of the 2021 Indian Premier League on 4 May 2021. In contrast, the New Zealand team had played a two match Test series against England in the first two weeks of June.\\nIf the match was either a draw or ended in a tie, both teams would have been declared as joint winners, sharing the trophy. On 14 June 2021, the ICC confirmed the prize money for the final: the winning team would receive US$1.6 million along with ICC Test Championship Mace, the losing team US$800,000, and the two teams would share US$2.4 million in the event of a draw.\\n\\n\\n== Road to the final ==\\n\\n\\n=== Route to the final ===\\n\\n\\n== Squads ==\\n\\nOn 15 June 2021, New Zealand confirmed their squad of 15 players for the match. Doug Bracewell, Jacob Duffy, Daryl Mitchell, Rachin Ravindra and Mitchell Santner, who were all part of New Zealand\\'s initial squad for the match, were not included in the final 15. On the same day India named their squad of 15 players for the match. Mayank Agarwal, K. S.
